summary:
abstract: "A STEM course redesign project has been implemented to improve retention of students in STEM majors (particularly underrepresented students). The Center for Life Sciences Education focused on Biology 1113 (ﬁrst semester Intro Bio), with four project components: a summer institute for faculty to learn about student-centered course design; a shared database of active learning resources; peer-led team learning; and embedded undergraduate research experiences. The Department of Mathematics is conducting a redesign of ﬁrst-year calculus. This project consists of multiple interventions (sections employing active learning, ﬂipped classroom pilots, open access textbooks) viewed through many lenses (including affective surveys and conceptual pre- and post-tests) and development of a framework for the cohesive interaction of the involved faculty and staff. Data that led to redesign of speciﬁc STEM courses, the status of these course redesign projects, and recent assessment efforts regarding the success of students in the redesigned courses will be discussed."
