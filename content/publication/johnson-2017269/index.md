abstract: <div>Answering a question posed by Bergelson and Leibman in [6], we establish a nilpotent version of the Polynomial Hales–Jewett Theorem that contains the main theorem in [6] as a special case. Important to the formulation and the proof of our main theorem is the notion of a relative syndetic set (relative with respect to a closed non-empty subsets of $\beta\mathbf{G}$) [25]. As a corollary of our main theorem we prove an extension of the restricted van der Waerden Theorem to nilpotent groups, which involves nilprogressions.</div>
