Welcome to my website **A Little Ink**!

I'm a mathematician at [the Ohio State University][osu]. My research interest is on the interplay between the algebraic structure of the [Stone–Čech compactification][SC], [dynamics][dynamics], and combinatorics related to [Ramsey theory][Ramsey theory]. Connected to this work, I've written papers with [Vitaly Bergelson][VB], [Neil Hindman][NH] (my PhD advisor), [Joel Moreira][JM], and [Florian Karl Richter][FKR]. See my [Publications]( {{< relref "#featured" >}} ) section for links to these papers.

 My teaching interest is centered around using active learning and inclusive practices to promote and cultivate an environment which improves students' abilities to construct, organize, and demonstrate their knowledge of mathematics. Recently, I've been working with my colleague [Ranthony A.C. Edmonds][RC] developing a new service-learning course based on Margot Lee Sterley's book [Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race][HF]. I'm also currently serving as PI for the **Building a Buckeye Calculus Community** as part of Ohio State's participation as a [Phase II institution](https://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/stem-education/seminal/phaseII.html) in [SEMINAL (Engagement in Mathematics through an Institutional Network for Active Learning)][SEMINAL].
